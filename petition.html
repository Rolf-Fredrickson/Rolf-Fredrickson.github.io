ONLINE PETITION <i>DRAFT</i>
<h1>
<h3>
Since the completion of the metro rail line along main street in the 1980s, the Niagara Frontier Metro Transit (NFTA) and the Citizens for Regional Transit (CRT) have sought to expand the rail line into more suburban parts of the city in order to connect specific retail and university services in the suburban areas. Rather than seeking a more direct route to the University of Buffalo north campus, NFTA/CRT are seeking a cheaper, more round-about alternative to push the metro rail past retail developments, such as the new 'Station 12' at the corner of Sheridan Dr. and Niagara Falls Blvd, on order to offer transportation to them.
<br><br>
The proposed path would swing down Main Street, in front of the University Plaza businesses, turning on Kenmore Avenue, then making a 90% turn onto Niagara Falls Blvd, coming above ground shortly after turning onto the Boulevard. Digging would not be approached solely from underground but would be access from above ground, digging down to the subway level.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, in spite of the prospect of an additional transportation option to those areas, other locations will become diminished, particularly the residential zoned areas that this new rail will cut through. This includes the western Eggertsville residential areas, in addition to the Kenilworth residential areas. Also, as the initial 1980s metro rail line development down Main Street showed, existing businesses in the University Plaza area will suffer reduced access during the construction time frame, which due to the nature of the project could be upwards of two years. Many of these businesses will not survive the construction process and will close. This in effect would be government choosing which businesses would prosper which we believe is of socioeconomic concern, as University Plaza typically services the residents of the Kensington/LaSalle areas.
<br><br>
As residents of those areas that have access to the existing subway line, we find it is seldom used because of outmoded operations in disrepair, and calls into question the need for the additional proposed expansion. We believe there is not any justification for the proposed expenditures (over 1 billion dollars) that cannot be met with a well-run, efficient, modern bus line that could have the flexibility to support multiple accesses, rather than simply one permanent linear path. For our area, this would be the logical 'first step' to any proposals to force urbanization on a community with a metro rail line extension.
<br><br>
Today, strolling in front of University Plaza you can see the pink markings where the utilities have been surveyed by Philadelphia company KCI Technologies.  Several environmental impact studies are in the process of being completed as required by law by the FTA (Federal Transit Authority) opening up public dialog Summer of 2023 at the conclusion of these studies. 
<br><br>
As residents, we already know the impact that these proposals will bring. Currently the CRT is describing this project as having 'wide community support'. Let your voices be heard regarding opposition to this proposal.  Show to them, as well as the FTA, that there are individuals that DO NOT support his initiative. This petition is your opportunity to have your voice heard.
